		CONTINUE. The agreement remains active and the failed payment amount is added to the outstanding balance. If auto-billing is enabled, PayPal automatically bills the outstanding balance in the next billing cycle.
		CANCEL PayPal creates the agreement but sets its state to pending until the initial payment clears. If the initial payment clears, the pending agreement becomes active. If the initial payment fails, the pending agreement is canceled.

    	    	  The target location is an object parameter that does not already exist. Adds a new parameter to the object.

    	    	  The target location is an object parameter that does exist. Replaces that parameter's value.

    	    	  The value parameter defines the value to add. For more information, see 4.1. add ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902#section-4.1 ).

    	    	remove. Removes the value at the target location. For the operation to succeed, the target location must exist. For more information, see 4.2. remove ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902#section-4.2 ).

    	    	replace. Replaces the value at the target location with a new value. The operation object must contain a value parameter that defines the replacement value. For the operation to succeed, the target location must exist. For more information, see 4.3. replace ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902#section-4.3 ).

    	    	move. Removes the value at a specified location and adds it to the target location. The operation object must contain a from parameter, which is a string that contains a JSON pointer value that references the location in the target document from which to move the value. For the operation to succeed, the from location must exist. For more information, see 4.4. move ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902#section-4.4 ).

    	    	copy. Copies the value at a specified location to the target location. The operation object must contain a from parameter, which is a string that contains a JSON pointer value that references the location in the target document from which to copy the value. For the operation to succeed, the from location must exist. For more information, see 4.5. copy ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902#section-4.5 ).

    	    	test. Tests that a value at the target location is equal to a specified value. The operation object must contain a value parameter that defines the value to compare to the target location's value. For the operation to succeed, the target location must be equal to the value value. For test, equal indicates that the value at the target location and the value that value defines are of the same JSON type. 

    	    	path string
    	    	The JSON Pointer to the target document location at which to complete the operation.

    	    	value number,integer,string,boolean,null,array,object
    	    	The value to apply. The remove operation does not require a value.

    start_date string required
    The date and time when this agreement begins, in Internet date and time format. The start date must be no less than 24 hours after the current date as the agreement can take up to 24 hours to activate.

    The start date and time in the create agreement request might not match the start date and time that the API returns in the execute agreement response. When you execute an agreement, the API internally converts the start date and time to the start of the day in the time zone of the merchant account. For example, the API converts a 2017-01-02T14:36:21Z start date and time for an account in the Berlin time zone (UTC + 1) to 2017-01-02T00:00:00. When the API returns this date and time in the execute agreement response, it shows the converted date and time in the UTC time zone. So, the internal 2017-01-02T00:00:00 start date and time becomes 2017-01-01T23:00:00 externally.

    The ID of the plan on which this agreement is based.

    The details for the customer who funds the payment. The API gathers this information from execution of the approval URL.
